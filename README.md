# sqrl-server-atmosphere

This java library is a companion to the [sqrl-server-base](https://github.com/sqrlserverjava/sqrl-server-base) project.  This library uses the [atomsphere framework](https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere) to allow the user to be logged into a site automatically once SQRL authentication has completed, as seen on the demo site: https://sqrljava.com:20000/sqrlexample/login
